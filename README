# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a Credit Card Fraud Detection System using machine learning in Python and deploying it as an interactive web app with Streamlit. The system aims to detect fraudulent transactions using powerful machine learning algorithms.


- Data preprocessing and handling imbalanced datasets.
- Feature engineering techniques for fraud detection.
- Building and training machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Evaluating model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Deploying the fraud detection system as a Streamlit web app.

## 📊 Topics Covered
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on financial transaction data.
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE or undersampling.
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
- Developing an interactive UI with Streamlit for real-time fraud detection.
